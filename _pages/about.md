I am a Lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Macao Polytechnic University. My academic and professional journey is rooted in a deep passion for statistics and its application to complex, real-world problems.

My research interests are centered on Bayesian statistical methodology and computation, with applications in diverse fields such as clinical trial design, drug development, change-point detection, and data mining. I am also keenly interested in statistical learning, feature screening, and portfolio selection.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics and Actuarial Science from The University of Hong Kong. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a Master of Science in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Statistics at Nankai University.

Before joining Macao Polytechnic University in September 2022, I gained valuable industry experience as a Pro-Manager and Data Analyst in the Financial Technology Department at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited. This role allowed me to apply my quantitative skills to practical challenges in the financial sector. My academic career also includes part-time lecturing at the City University of Macau and research assistant roles at The University of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My work has been published in respected academic journals, including Nature Human Behaviour, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), and Quantitative Finance. I have also had the honor of presenting my research at international conferences, such as the Annual Meeting of the Society for Clinical Trials, where I was a finalist for the Thomas Chalmers Student Scholarship in 2017.

As an educator, I have taught a wide range of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, covering topics from Linear Algebra and Probability to Advanced SAS Programming and Statistics in Clinical Medicine.

I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and statistical software, including Python, R, SAS, and STAN, which I utilize extensively in my research and teaching.
