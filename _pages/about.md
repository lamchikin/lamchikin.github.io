I am a Lecturer in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Macao Polytechnic University. My academic and professional journey is rooted in a deep passion for statistics and its application to complex, real-world problems.

My research interests are centered on Bayesian statistical methodology and computation, with applications in diverse fields such as clinical trial design, drug development, change-point detection, and data mining. I am also keenly interested in statistical learning, feature screening, and portfolio selection.

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics and Actuarial Science from The University of Hong Kong. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a Master of Science in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Statistics at Nankai University.

My work has been published in Nature Human Behaviour, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), and Quantitative Finance.
